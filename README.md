WCAP Provider
=============

This is the source code for the Sun Java System Calendar Server (WCAP) provider. It used to live in
[comm-central](https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/), but has been effectively unmaintained for
quite some time. Therefore in [bug 1579020](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1579020) it
was removed.

I've taken basic measures to make it installable as an extension, but there are no guarantees it
still works. It is still unmaintained, but I am keeping the code here for archiving purposes and in
case someone wants to pick it up for a legacy system.

You are strongly encouraged to migrate to a system that uses CalDAV.
